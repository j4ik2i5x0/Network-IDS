# IDS: Intrusion Detection System using Deep Learning

**IDS** is a deep learning-based approach for detecting network intrusions and malicious activities. This repository contains the code implementation of the IDS model, along with instructions for usage, evaluation metrics, and additional resources.

## Overview

Network security is a critical aspect of modern computing, and malicious activities such as denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, data breaches, and unauthorized access pose a significant threat to organizations. **IDS** (Intrusion Detection System) offers a solution by leveraging deep learning techniques to accurately classify network traffic data, enhancing cybersecurity measures.

## Dataset

The IDS model was trained on a dataset comprising both **benign network traffic** and **various attack scenarios** such as **DDoS**, **Port Scans**, **Web Attacks**, and **Data Exfiltration**. Due to privacy and licensing restrictions, the dataset used for training is not provided in this repository. However, users can train the model on their own datasets or use publicly available datasets for experimentation, such as:

- **CICIDS 2017** dataset ([Link](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/index.html))

### Dataset Structure

- **Features**: The dataset includes network traffic logs with features such as:
  - Packet size
  - Source/Destination IP addresses
  - Source/Destination Ports
  - Protocol type (TCP, UDP, etc.)
  - Duration of connection
  - Flow statistics (bytes per second, packets per second)
- **Labels**: The dataset should include a label column to classify whether the traffic is benign or malicious (with labels such as **0** for benign and **1** for malicious).

### Data Preprocessing

- Normalize numeric features to ensure they fall within a similar range.
- Handle missing data by either removing rows or imputing missing values.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets (usually 80% for training and 20% for testing).
- Convert categorical features to numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding).

## Results

The effectiveness of the IDS model is demonstrated through comprehensive evaluation metrics, including:

- **Accuracy**: Measures the overall correctness of the model's predictions.
- **Precision**: Evaluates the proportion of true positives out of all positive predictions.
- **Recall**: Measures the model's ability to detect actual positive cases (malicious traffic).
- **F1-score**: A harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced evaluation metric.
- **Sensitivity**: The ability of the model to correctly identify malicious instances.
- **Specificity**: The ability of the model to correctly identify benign instances.
- **ROC AUC**: Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, indicating the model's ability to distinguish between benign and malicious traffic.
